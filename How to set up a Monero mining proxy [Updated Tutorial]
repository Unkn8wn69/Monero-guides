Here is a quick and simple tutorial on how to setup xmrig-proxy.I made it yesterday cause I saw many poeple struggle with setting it up.

1. Download xmrig-proxy for your operating system on https://xmrig.com/download/proxy
2. Go to [https://config.xmrig.com/proxy](https://config.xmrig.com/proxy) and go through the pages and Fill in your settings. (Easiest is just Hashvault.pro Pool)
3. Copy the text in the field and paste it into the config.json in your xmrig-proxy folder.
4. open start.cmd(or ./xmrig-proxy on Linux) and look out for errors
5. if there are no errors you can now see your Hashrate by pressing "h" and your workers by pressing "w".

(optional)

1. For testing Download XMRig here: https://xmrig.com/download
2. Go to https://xmrig.com/wizard and Click on "new configuration" and then on add Proxy.
3. Fill in your xmrig-proxy hosting mashine IP (or 127.0.0.1 if localhost) and your port.
4. Click through and copy the text into the config.json in your xmrig folder.
5. Start xmrig.cmd (or ./xmrig on Linux)Now you should see the new workers when you press W in the terminal of the xmrig-proxy. 
You can try to make a Panel with the API: https://xmrig.com/docs/miner/api 
but as of today there are no offical Panels out there supporting the newest API.
