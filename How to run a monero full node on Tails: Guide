What are the benefits of a local full node?

- No sync times once the full node is synced
- No 3rd party being able to see your transaction-IDs combined with your IP
- Strengthening of the network (if you open/forward ports)
- Own blockexplorer!

What do I need to get started?

- A tails USB stick with optionally Persistent Storage enabled. (https://tails.boum.org/install/)
- An computer/laptop with >4GB Ram
- An 256GB+ USB3.0 Drive/SSD/HDD
- Boot into your host operating system and install the monero-cli wallet from getmonero.org
- On windows just unzip the package, for linux you will have to execute the following commands:

mkdir monero
tar -xjvf linux64 -C monero

3. Open the terminal in the monero directory and execute the command:

./monerod --data-dir /path/to/the/drive 
or 
monerod.exe --data-dir /path/to/the/drive

4. Now let the blockchain synchronize

5. Once the blockchain is fully synced, shut down your computer and boot with the earlier created TailsOS USB stick.

6. In Tails, open the terminal in your desired location and download the monero-cli-wallet with the simple command:

wget https://downloads.getmonero.org/cli/linux64

7. Now create a new directory and unarchive the archive with:

mkdir monero 
tar -xjvf linux64 -C monero

8. cd into the directory and create a start-script with:

cd monero
nano startmonerod.sh

9. Paste in the following, and replace /blockchain/directory with the path to the blockchain directory on your drive. (usually /home/USERNAME/.bitmonero on linux)

#/!/bin/bash
sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 2 -p tcp -d 127.0.0.1 -m tcp --dport 18081 -j ACCEPT
DNS_PUBLIC=tcp TORSOCKS_ALLOW_INBOUND=1 torsocks ./monerod --p2p-bind-ip 127.0.0.1 --no-igd --rpc-bind-ip 127.0.0.1 --data-dir /blockchain/directory

10. Save and exit the editor with (CTRL + O) & (CTRL X)

11. Start the script

sh ./startmonerod.sh

12. Let the last blocks sync (~0.1 Blocks/Second)

Now you're done and your local node should be synced and running.

You can now open your preferred wallet and enter 127.0.0.1:18081 as your node address. I recommend using either the original CLI/GUI wallet or the featherwallet which is available on featherwallet.org.

I hope you liked my small tutorial/Guide.

If you still want to use a remote node, you are free to use my freshly setup onion node over:
